# CS5424_Project
# Distributed Database System


The objective of this project is to provide students the opportunity to acquire practical experience with using distributed database systems for application development. The learning tasks in this project involve the following: how to install a distributed database system on a cluster of machines, how to design a data model and implement transactions to support an application by taking into consideration of the workload of the application and the features of the database system, and how to benchmark the performance of an application.

In this project, you will be developing an application for a wholesale supplier using two different APIs of YugabyteDB (https://www.yugabyte.com/): a Cassandra-compatible API
(YCQL https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/api/ycql/) and a PostgreSQL-compatible API (YSQL https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/api/ysql/).
